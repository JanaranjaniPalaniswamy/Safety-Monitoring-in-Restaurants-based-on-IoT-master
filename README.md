# Safety-Monitoring-in-Restaurants-based-on-IoT

**Abstract**
In the recent years, food and its connectivity with restaurants are inseparable. Kitchen plays the important role in restaurants. At the same time, it is more prone to accidents and hence safety in kitchen is a critical issue. The main reasons for accidents include cooking fires, flammable materials and gas leaks which should be addressed immediately. The purpose of this project is to monitor kitchen safety using Internet of Things (IoT). So, a smart safety monitoring system is proposed which mainly aims at ensuring safety in kitchen by monitoring the outbreak of fire, gas leaks and air quality( concentration of CO2). In addition to safety, the system also aids in comfort by notifying status and
booking of new cylinder and maintaining the room temperature constant involving warming or cooling compared to outside temperature.



**Steps involved:**
Implemented a safety monitoring system using ubiquitous architecture. 
Simulated the restaurant kitchen environment using simulatedIoT. 
Communicated the data to Raspberry Pi and clients with an indirect communication using MQTT protocol.
Made the system work autonomous without human intervention using AI planning with PDDL logic.
